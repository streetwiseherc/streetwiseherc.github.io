Friday September 4th 1998
It was the first show of the semester, and things went ok.   
After DC's sloppy miscue of his new intro, everything looked like it
was about to fall apart.  After things got rollin and many a dope tracks
were played, the night ended up going by too fast.  I guess that could
be because it's an hour shorter.
